Direct to consumer marketing

A new age of direct to consumer marketing is emerging- one where blockchain technology combines with traditional methods of targeting a consumer's chosen brand preferences. All tracked, secure and 100% verifiable.

This new form of brand recognition program can identify and reward the individual for their contributions/loyalty to the brand, and specifically, certain product lanes within that brand (think skiing-only products within the Patagonia brand). Individuals specify which brands they are partial to, eliminating the shear amount of unwanted noise from other irrelevant companies vying for the individual's attention.

Brand-specific loyalty programs like this don't need to be complex or difficult to orchestrate. If you have a platform where people declare what their preferences are then brands and users can converge here with convenience and ease.

Brands can build, target, and deliver their campaign

Cons:
- brand-specific has potential to make people very myopic and less open to emerging opportunities; can work for certain demographics and needs, and is purely opt-in
- 

Pros:
- significantly reduces the amount of spam, even within already specified companies
- Offers highly specific consumer information to be used by brands to deliver targeted and relevant product updates, thereby making both the brand and user's experience more pleasant
