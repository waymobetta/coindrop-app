Direct to consumer marketing

A new age of direct to consumer marketing is emerging- one where blockchain technology combines with a new method for targeting chosen brand preferences to recognize and reward the consumer. All tracked, secure and 100% verifiable.

This new form of brand recognition can identify and reward the individual for their contributions/loyalty to the overall brand as well as specifically within certain product lanes of that brand (think skiing-only products of Patagonia). 

Individuals specify which brands they are partial to, eliminating the shear amount of unwanted noise from other irrelevant companies vying for the individual's attention. Furthermore, as highlighted above, individuals can specify which segments within these preferred brands that they are most interested in, providing further filtering for the individual and reducing a lot of guesswork for the brand.

An example campaign, taken from the above:
- Patagonia has a new jacket made specifically for snow-bound-activities. I, as a Coindrop user, have expressed my interest in Patagonia and specified which product categories I'd like to learn more about- in this case, Skiing. 
- Patagonia creates a campaign for this specific jacket- providing an explanation about the product and perhaps even quizzing me on it.
- Based on the results of this quiz I am provided with a voucher up to, say, 30% off, knowing I am now knowledgable and highly likely to convert (affordable to them because it is not available to the masses)
- I learn a little about the jacket through this campaign, am offered the voucher (perhaps for in-store use only), and now I am effectively a micro-brand ambassador.

This type of a marketing campaign is extremely targeted and has potential to be highly effective if conducted correctly- a low-volume, specifically tailored approach to make the individual feel uniquely recognized. 

Brand-specific loyalty programs like this don't need to be complex or difficult to orchestrate. Coindrop provides a platform where people declare what their preferences are then brands and users can converge here with convenience and ease.

Brands can build, target, deliver and track their campaign all within the platform.

Cons:
- brand-specificity has potential to make people very myopic and less open to emerging opportunities; can work for certain demographics and needs, and is purely opt-in
- 

Pros:
- significantly reduces the amount of spam, even within already specified companies
- offers highly specific consumer information to be used by brands to deliver targeted and relevant product updates, thereby making both the brand and user's experience more pleasant
